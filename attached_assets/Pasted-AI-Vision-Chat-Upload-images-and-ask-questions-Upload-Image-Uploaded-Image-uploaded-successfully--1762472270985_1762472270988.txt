Problem 1: Newton's Law of Gravitation and Orbital Mechanics

#

▸
Step 1: State Newton's Law of Gravitation
Newton's law of gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

F = G (m_1 m_2/r^2)
where:

- F is the gravitational force between the masses,

- G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2),

- m_1 and m_2 are the masses of the two objects, and

- r is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

Step 2: Determine the Mass \( M \) of the Star
Given that:

T^2 = (4π^2/GM) R^3
We need to rearrange this equation to solve for M:

M = (4π^2/G) (R^3/T^2)
From the graph, we can choose a point to find M. Let's use R^3 = 1.0 × 10^{34} \, \text{m}^3 and T^2 = 1.0 \, \text{year}^2. First, convert T^2 into seconds:

1 \, \text{year} = 3.156 × 10^7 \, \text{s}
T^2 = (3.156 × 10^7)^2 \, \text{s}^2 = 9.948 × 10^{14} \, \text{s}^2
However, to simplify calculations and avoid unit conversions for G, let's directly use the given data and known values:

G = 6.674 × 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2
To find M, we actually need to directly use the graph or given data more effectively. Assuming we find the gradient of the graph is k, then:

T^2 = kR^3
Comparing with the given formula:

k = (4π^2/GM)
Thus,

M = (4π^2/Gk)
Without the exact value of k from the graph here, let's assume we find k = 2.5 × 10^{-34} \, \text{s}^2/\text{m}^3 from the graph (this step requires actual graph data which isn't directly provided):

M = (4π^2/6.674 × 10^{-11) × 2.5 × 10^{-34}}
M = (4π^2/1.6685 × 10^{-44)}
M ≈ (39.478/1.6685 × 10^{-44)}
M ≈ 2.36 × 10^{30} \, \text{kg}

Step 3: Explain Why Gravitational Potential Energy is Negative
The gravitational potential energy U of an object of mass m at a distance r from a mass M is given by:

U = -(GMm/r)
The negative sign indicates that the potential energy is negative because the gravitational force is attractive. It means that work must be done to separate the masses to infinity where U = 0.

▸
Step 4: Show That the Kinetic Energy \( E_k \) of the Rock is Given By \( \frac{GMm}{2r} \)
For a rock in orbit around a star:

(mv^2/r) = (GMm/r^2)
mv^2 = (GMm/r)
E_k = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2) (GMm/r)
E_k = (GMm/2r)
#

▸
Step 5: Derive an Expression for the Total Energy of the Rock
The total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy E_k and potential energy U:

E = E_k + U = (GMm/2r) - (GMm/r)
E = -(GMm/2r)
